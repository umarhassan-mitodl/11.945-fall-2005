As a practicum course, the class developed over the course of the semester in response to student analysis and client feedback. The following schedule captures the original scaffolding on which the course was built, and includes all of the elements that students had an opportunity to pursue over the course of the semester. As studnets learned more about the North End community, they chose to emphasize some of the economic development techniques over others, and they used some of the lecture sessions as work time, consulting with faculty when they had specific questions about the models presented at the beginning of the semester. Most of the students also scheduled site visits on a more regular basis than the once-a-month required trips.

This course is broken down into regularly numbered sessions and 4 scheduled field trips (FT), designated FT1, FT2, FT3, FT4.

Class discussion will focus on any differences between what was observed during the field visit versus the impressions taken from the background reports. We will also discuss what information is needed for the first phase of the project, how our existing information matches these needs, information gaps and how to address them. A review will also be made of the resources available to the class and protocols established for working with and sharing digital files. Class time will also be devoted to our organization and work plan for the first project phase.
